Posha Assignment: Nachiket Dalvi

- I have used esp32 to complete this particular assignment.
- The code for the same is in 'esp32_project', inside the main folder. Rest of the files are configuration sfiles for the Cmake build process that esp-idf uses.
- On the PC side I have written a simple python script, 'Serial_TX_RX' which sends the data and then receives it and prints it on the console.
- I have included the video required as well.
- I have also provided comments wherever I felt was necessary to explain the code.
- My hardware setup was a simple one consisting of an esp32 devkit, connected to my PC via USB- TTL converter.
